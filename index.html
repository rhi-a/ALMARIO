						<h1> Edited By: James L. Tarth</h1>
						<p>Mr. Tarth is a dedicated journalist, writer, father, husband, and co-worker.
						Dedicating his life in parts investigative journalism, being a family man,
						and the guy that always fixes the coffee machine, he also manages to find a way
						to help out in this magazine. Among many others, he has edited the <a href="whoops.html">May '21</a>, 
						<a href="whoops.html">Aug '18</a>, and <a href="whoops.html">Jun '18</a> issues.</p>

						<h1> Chief Writer: Peter Jailhem</h1>
						<p>Whilst his status as a freed man untouched by law is argued about daily,
						his many achievements and accolades in the field of archaeology cannot be 
						denied (which is what he does, whenever his 'crimes' are brought up). He has been
						a big fan of the magazine, and to celebrate his 22nd pushed-back court date, we 
						thought we'd let him write something.</p>

				<h6 class="subt">editor's note</h6>
				<div id="text">
					<p>To celebrate international archaeology day, we at thedusts have 
					decided to not be cliche and not make this month's issue about the 
					history, the goal, the nows, the thens, the tomorrows, the whats, the whys,
					the whos, and whatever elses of archaeology. That was a lie. That's totally what this
					month is about. Lying is fun. You know who else is a liar? The chief writer when he 
					was on the stand. under oath. in front of a jury. During this weird niche holiday, it is
					important that we cherish and share the importance of archaeology. Which is why we 
					have decided to give another one of those abridged versions of the magazine.
					This month also marks the 22nd year from when this magazine first started
					getting published! Time just passes by, doesn't it? It's like those past 22 years didn't
					happen. You know what other timeframe didn't happen? Peter Jailhem on December 15th, 2005, 6pm to
					3am the next day. What happened, Jailhem?</p>

				<h1 class="texthead">THE START FOR <br> THE START OF IT ALL</h1>
				<div id="text">
					<p>Often mistaken with the study of dinosaur bones (that's down the left, the Paleontology 
					office), Archaeology, as a field, is the study of the human timeline by examining materials
					left behind from bygone times. In our work, we study all types of remain left behind by the
					human species. These are called 'Artifacts'. An artifact can be anything created, destroyed, 
					modified, and used by a human being. The word "Archaeology" is derived from the greek word
					for ancient, "arkhaios". <br> The earliest form of technically archaeology is through
					acts of looting such as grave robbing and ransacking. <br> It later evolved into a much 
					more formal form after the rise of antiqurianism and the Italian fetish for ancient Greece.
					<br>
					Today, archaeologists study dig sites all over the world to try piece the 15,000 
					year old puzzle of the entire human story. The history of this study of history is quite 
					a long one, funnily enough. Buy the full issue and read all about it!	</p>

			<h1 class="texthead">TO UNDERSTAND IT ALL</h1>
			<div id="text">
				<p>Archaeologists employ many methods and strategies to try and put together an ancient human
				society. <br> As mentioned, there are the artifacts. <br> Artifacts could be anything, from
				a jagged stone knife to your mother. Other hints, such as geographical location,
				local ecosystems, non-human remains, and etc, are utilized by archaeologists to further their
				investigations. <br> This is what sets apart Archaeology from Paleontology. Where as the latter
				is the study of mere plant and animal remains, the former is the study of actual life-- societies
				and dynamics, people and their lives, their culture, their art, their diet, and much more.

			<h1 class="texthead">THE MINDS BEHIND IT ALL</h1>
			<div id="text">
				<p>There are many different fields of archaeology, such as: bioarcheology (which specifies in 
				human remains), zooarcheology (which focuses on animals), paleoethnobotany (the study of old
				plants), and lithics (concerned with stone workings) <br>
				It is difficult to place archaeology in a specific group of science. <br>
				Whilst it is mostly acknowledged as a branch of anthropology, some consider it to simply
				be a study of human history, and the most radical of all think of the field as a social
				science. <br> Would an archaeologist be considered a historian? Or is he a scientist? Is he
				a doctor? Read the full version to hear what real, respected archaeologists have to think.
